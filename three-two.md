Prompt for GPT Editing Assistance

I am working on writing sections of an application for my hospital to achieve the “Pathway to Excellence” designation awarded by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). This designation recognizes healthcare organizations that foster positive work environments where nurses can thrive. It signifies that an organization meets specific standards for excellence in nursing practice, including supportive leadership, collaborative relationships, professional development opportunities, and a commitment to quality patient care.

As part of the application, I need to write Evidence of Performance (EOP) sections. EOPs are specific narratives that demonstrate how our organization meets the criteria set by the ANCC for the Pathway to Excellence designation.

I need your assistance in editing my latest draft for EOP 3.2. Below, I have included:

	1.	The exact wording of EOP 3.2.
	2.	The detailed guidelines for EOP 3.2.
	3.	My Latest Draft of EOP 3.2
	4.	Editing Suggestions/Questions From the Editor

Please review my draft, consider the editing suggestions, and provide an edited version that incorporates the feedback, aligns with the guidelines, and is written professionally, concisely, and clearly.

Exact Wording of EOP 3.2:

“Describe how direct care nurses are involved in (1) reporting and (2) improvement strategy(ies) to prevent nurse-related safety events from re-occurring.”

Detailed Guidelines for EOP 3.2:

Explain the structures and processes used by the organization to include direct care nurses (not just one nurse) in addressing nurse-related safety events. Structures might include formal and informal groups, councils, committees, task forces that meet to discuss nurse-related safety events; the charter statements; and policies, protocols, and/or bylaws.

Processes are the descriptions of how direct care nurses are supported to report these events and then participate in improvement methodologies to prevent them and improve nurse safety. Direct care nurse involvement could be membership in the shared decision-making alliance or attendance at staff meetings where nurse safety data is reported and reviewed, and improvements are planned and implemented.

Be sure to describe how the direct care nurse(s) are active participants in both reporting and improving. Nurse-related safety events could include needlestick injuries, shoulder or back injury, or exposure to contagious conditions. This EOP is focused on nurse data (not all employees).

This should be a general description of the structures and processes. Do not provide specific examples.

Key Words:

	•	Process for reporting, and improving
	•	Nurse-related safety events
	•	Direct Care Nurse(s) involvement

No evidence is required for this EOP. However, it’s suggested that the organization include evidence that enhances the response. Be selective in including evidence due to the 750-page document limit. A rule of thumb is to average 10 pages per EOP including the evidence.

Suggested items may include the committee reporting structures, a procedure explaining the process for reporting incidents, copies of nurse-safety incident reports, aggregated employee health reports, committee meeting minutes, performance improvement plans, root cause analysis, and data dashboards or scorecards.

My Latest Draft of EOP 3.2:

**A. Describe**
Direct care nurses (DCNs) at Corewell Health Watervliet Hospital (CHWH) play a central role in both the reporting of nurse-related safety events and the development of strategies to prevent their recurrence.


*Reporting*
DCNs utilize the electronic Pause reporting system to document nurse-related safety events such as needlestick injuries, patient handling incidents, and exposure to infectious agents. The Pause system is an accessible, user-friendly platform that allows nurses to report incidents promptly and confidentially. By providing detailed information about each event, DCNs contribute valuable data that informs safety analyses and improvement efforts.


In addition to formal reporting through Pause, DCNs are encouraged to share nurse-related safety concerns during regular team huddles. These huddles offer a structured opportunity for nurses to raise immediate safety issues in a collaborative environment. This practice fosters a proactive approach to safety, as nurse leaders and team members work together to find quick, effective solutions to emerging risks. The consistent inclusion of safety discussions in these huddles ensures that safety remains at the forefront of patient care.


Does CHWH have an annual safety survey? If so, this could be another structure to describe where nurses can report safety concerns.

*Improvement Strategies*
At CHWH, DCNs are integral to developing and implementing improvement strategies aimed at preventing the recurrence of nurse-related safety events. After an event is reported through the PAUSE system, nurses engage in a reflective process to identify if and how the event could have been prevented. This self-assessment within the PAUSE system allows DCNs to contribute their insights directly to the event analysis.


Nurse leaders and the Occupational Health team follow up with DCNs involved in reported incidents to discuss potential improvement strategies. These collaborative discussions focus on identifying root causes and developing actionable plans to enhance nurse safety. By involving DCNs in these conversations, CHWH ensures that frontline perspectives inform safety initiatives.


Trends in nurse-related safety events are regularly reviewed during staff meetings, team huddles, and unit-based practice council meetings. These forums provide opportunities for DCNs to share experiences, disseminate lessons learned, and collectively brainstorm solutions. The open dialogue fosters a culture of continuous improvement and keeps nurse safety at the forefront of team priorities.


When nurse-related safety events are linked to knowledge gaps, DCNs can request targeted education and training. CHWH supports these requests by providing resources and learning opportunities to address specific needs. This proactive approach empowers nurses to enhance their competencies and reduces the likelihood of future incidents.


Moreover, when changes are implemented to improve nurse safety, DCNs are actively involved in the feedback process. Their input is solicited to evaluate the effectiveness of new protocols or interventions. This feedback loop ensures that improvements are practical, effective, and well-received by those directly impacted.

Editing Suggestions from consultant for My Latest Draft:
- Change occurrences of "PAUSE" in all caps to just "Pause" with first letter capitalized.
- Questions from editor: 
    - Does CHWH have an annual safety survey? If so, this could be another structure to describe where nurses can report safety concerns.
    -  Exhibits/Evidence – is there a policy or procedure regarding the Pause system? Can you provide a redacted copy of nurse-safety reported incident via Pause?
        - Editor instructs me to reach out to Rita Brandt to ask these questions.



Instructions:

	•	Please focus on ensuring that the edited draft:
	•	Addresses both aspects of the EOP: reporting and improvement strategies.
	•	Clearly describes the structures and processes that involve direct care nurses in reporting nurse-related safety events and in developing improvement strategies.
	•	Is concise, professional, and aligns with the tone of the rest of the application.
	•	Ensure that the draft does not include specific examples but provides a general description of the structures and processes.
	•	Incorporate the editing suggestions provided

Additional Instruction: Draft a professional email to Rita Brandt to ask the questions I mentioned, making sure to provide sufficient context so she can understand. Briefly explain the Pathway to Excellence, what I am writing, why I need the information that I am asking for.


Thank you for your assistance!
