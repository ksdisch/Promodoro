# EOP 3.1 v3 Editing Prompt

I am working on writing sections of an application for my hospital to achieve the "Pathway to Excellence" designation awarded by the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC). This designation recognizes healthcare organizations that foster positive work environments where nurses can thrive. It signifies that an organization meets specific standards for excellence in nursing practice, including supportive leadership, collaborative relationships, professional development opportunities, and a commitment to quality patient care.

As part of the application, I need to write Evidence of Performance (EOP) sections. EOPs are specific narratives that demonstrate how our organization meets the criteria set by the ANCC for the Pathway to Excellence designation.

I need your assistance in editing my latest draft for EOP 3.1. Below, I have included:

1. The exact wording of EOP 3.1.
2. The detailed guidelines for EOP 3.1.
3. My latest draft of EOP 3.1
4. The editing suggestions I have received for EOP 3.1 (including the example that needs to be included for part B)
5. The example for part B that needs to be added.

**Please review my draft, consider the editing suggestions, and provide an edited version that incorporates the feedback, aligns with the guidelines, and is written professionally, concisely, and clearly.**

### **Exact Wording of EOP 3.1:**

a. Describe the process(es) used by the organization to involve direct care nurses in: (1) reporting, (2) event analysis, and (3) identifying trends of patient safety-related events.

AND

b. Provide one example of a direct care nurse’s involvement in identifying a trend of a patient related safety event, including: (1) how the trend was addressed and (2) the end result. Include the date(s) the trend was identified within the required 36-month timeframe.

### **Expanded and More Detailed Guidelines for EOP 3.1 Parts A and B:**

a. Explain the structures and processes the organization employs to include direct care nurses (not just one DCN) in reporting, analyzing, and using data to improve patient-related safety events. Structures might include formal and informal groups, councils, committees, or task forces that meet to discuss patient-related safety events. Processes are the descriptions of how these direct care nurses are supported to participate in activities where the patient-related safety events and the performance improvement methodologies to improve patient safety are reported, reviewed, and discussed. Direct care nurse involvement could be membership in the shared decision-making alliance or attendance at staff meetings where patient safety data is reported and reviewed, and trends are identified. Be sure to describe how the direct care nurse(s) are active participants in reporting, reviewing, and identifying trends.

Patient-related safety events could include trips, slips and falls; medical errors; hospital acquired conditions (HAC); or adverse drug events. This should be a general description of the structures and processes. Do not provide specific examples in this section.


Key Words:

· Process for reporting, reviewing, and trending

· Patient-related safety events

· Direct care nurse involvement

b. Provide an example when a direct care nurse participated in identifying a trend of patient-related safety events(s) as discussed in 3.1a. Discuss who the direct care nurse was, when and how they participated in noting the trend. The direct care nurse must be an active participant in identifying the trend. Also discuss what actions were taken to respond to the trend and the result. Provide details about how their involvement contributed to the resolution. The involvement must have occurred within 36 months of document submission.

· Used process described in 3.1a

· Identifying a trend in patient-related safety events No evidence is required for this EOP. However, HLX suggests that the organization include evidence that enhances the response. Be selective in including evidence due to the 750-page document limit. A rule of thumb is to average 10 pages per EOP including the evidence. Suggested items may include minutes from staff meetings where patient-related safety events are discussed as a focus for improvement, the process for reporting incidents, redacted copies of patient-safety incident reports, redacted aggregated risk management reports, committee meeting minutes, committee reporting structures, huddle boards, performance improvement plans, root cause analysis, and data dashboards or scorecards.

**Key Words:**

- Process for reporting, and improving
- Nurse-related safety events
- Direct Care Nurse(s) involvement

No evidence is required for this EOP. However, it's suggested that the organization include evidence that enhances the response. Be selective in including evidence due to the 750-page document limit. A rule of thumb is to average 10 pages per EOP including the evidence.

Suggested items may include the committee reporting structures, a procedure explaining the process for reporting incidents, copies of nurse-safety incident reports, aggregated employee health reports, committee meeting minutes, performance improvement plans, root cause analysis, and data dashboards or scorecards.

### **My Latest Draft of EOP 3.1:**

A. Describe

Direct care nurses (DCNs) at Corewell Health Watervliet Hospital (CHWH) play a central role in both the reporting, event analysis and identifying of trends of nurse patient-related safety events.


Reporting

At CHWH, the process for reporting nurse-related safety events begins the moment an incident occurs. When a safety event is identified, it is promptly logged into the hospital’s Electronic Reporting System (ERS) by the DCN involved or any other team member who witnessed the event. This immediate documentation ensures that all relevant details are captured accurately and in real-time. Once the event is logged, hospital leadership follows up by meeting with the nurse or team members involved. This step is critical, as it provides an opportunity for the DCNs to give a first-hand description of the event and voice any concerns or ideas for improvements. By encouraging DCNs to share their insights, the hospital fosters an environment where nurses feel confident that their concerns will be heard and addressed.


DCNs are encouraged to share their thoughts, concerns, and ideas regarding safety during regular team huddles. These huddles provide a structured opportunity for nurses to raise immediate patient safety concerns in a collaborative environment. This practice fosters a proactive approach to safety, as nurse leaders and team members work together to find quick, effective solutions to any risks that arise. The consistent inclusion of safety discussions in these huddles ensures that safety remains at the forefront of patient care. Through these informal structures, DCNs at CHWH are empowered to address patient safety risks at the source, enhancing the hospital’s ability to respond to emerging issues swiftly and effectively.


Event Analysis

Following the reporting of a safety event, direct care nurses at CHWH are key contributors to the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) process. Their participation is essential because they provide first-hand experience and critical patient care insights that can help identify underlying causes more accurately. This direct involvement also gives nurses the confidence that their concerns are being taken seriously and that they will not face any repercussions for raising safety issues. This approach not only improves the analysis but also encourages nurses to continue reporting safety events in the future. Briefly discuss who organizes the RCA and how the DCNs participate.


Identifying Trends

At CHWH, direct care nurses DCNs are actively involved in formal committees and councils that are essential to sustaining a strong safety culture. Key among these are the Nurse Professional Practice Councils and central Safety Committees, where DCNs nurses play a vital role in reviewing safety reports and contributing to process improvement corrective actions. These groups convene regularly to ensure that safety events reported by nurses are thoroughly evaluated, and meaningful improvements are implemented.



B. Example

Identify a DCN that was involved in identifying a patient safety trend – make sure to use at least one of the structures identified in part A.


*Going to set up a meeting with Deborah Busch to come up with an example for this ^* 

### **Editing Suggestions for My Latest Draft:**


* Need the Example identified for part B
    * In part B, make sure the example is something that was talked about in Part A
    * Ideally, Data to back up any evident trends would be awesome as well. Ask Deborah Busch if she has anything to include
    * Make sure the example used is within the required 36-month timeframe and that dates are included.

#### **Email from Deborah Busch with the Event and Associated Data **

Morning Kyle,

The event we discussed was an unwitnessed patient fall on 9-14-2024. The patient fell in the bathroom, and no one was aware the patient was in the bathroom in the first place because she had no bed alarm.


So after discussion and brainstorming in staff meetings amongst nursing leaders and all nurses, we decided on the following: 
- Each patient has a bed alarm on their bed, as well as on their wheelchairs etc due to the trend of increased falls on our unit.
- We are doing many more “room checks” daily checking for compliance with this new increase in bed alarms. We have been tracking the associated on bed alarm compliance percentages, which have been rising,  and we have been screening double the patients. as you can see from the trend data below.

 
Here’s the “trend data” from my boss Tara, associated with our “Falls/Safety” awareness plan.

Patient Bed Alarm Compliance Trend Data
May---63% (25/40)….

June—72% (29/40)…

July--- 70%

August--- 80%

Sept--- 85% (104/122)…

 

The fall that happened on 9-14-2024 would be the one that I would use for that prompted the changes we implemented in this scenario.

 

 I feel that our compliance percentages have steadily gone up due to our increased awareness for the need of compliance between therapies and nursing staff to ensure that patients always are in the “presence” of either their bed alarm or chair alarm.    As you can see from the percentages above, our compliance rate has gone up, and we have been screening double the patients.

 

Warmly,

Debb Busch RN BSN CRRN
